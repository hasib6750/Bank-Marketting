# Bank Marketing Project

### Project Overview
This project uses the Bank Marketing dataset to analyze marketing strategies and predict the outcome of a marketing campaign through various machine learning models. The dataset consists of features such as age, job type, balance, and more, which are used to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

### Dataset Source
Bank Marketing Dataset

### References
- List item 1
